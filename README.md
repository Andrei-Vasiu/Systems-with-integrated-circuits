LT Spice is a special program for simulating electronic circuit functions. Common circuit elements such as passive devices (resistors, capacitors, current and voltage sources) or active (diodes, bipolar and MOS transistors, operational amplifiers) are available in the component library, having associate a number of parameters (in the case of passive components) or a model (for active components).

In this project I aimed to perform several simulations in the LTspice program on various circuits, such as the behavior of a voltage-current amplifier, Tow Thomas filter, PGA, Peak Detect, and finally, the verification and characterization of the analog interface.
In this project, I started by dimensioning the circuits according to the values ​​specified in the requirement, then simulating each circuit in several stages. For example, simulations such as: ac, dc, transient, linear domain. Using dc .op analysis we can calculate the static operating point of the circuit (PSF or DC Operating Point). Ac analysis allows visualizing the frequency response of a circuit for a fixed frequency domain. Lastly, the transient analysis is used to determine if the clipping phenomenon occurred at the output signal of the circuit and to evaluate the nonlinearities we need a transient analysis. Transient analysis is a large signal analysis that takes nonlinearities into account and allows visualization of the evolution of a circuit over time.
